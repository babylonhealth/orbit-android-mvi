## Overview

Orbit 2 is a simple scaffolding you can build a Redux/MVI-like architecture
around.

In Orbit 2 we have taken the best features of Orbit 1 and rewritten the rest
from scratch.

### Powerful and flexible design üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- Integrates best practices from our 2+ years of experience with MVI
- Powered by coroutines
- Easy to use, type-safe, extensible API

### Works with any async/stream framework üîÄ

- Coroutine, RxJava (1 2 & 3!) and LiveData operator support

### Orbit ‚ù§Ô∏è Android

- Subscribe to state and side effects through Flow
- ViewModel support, along with SavedState!

### Testing ü§ñ

- Unit test framework designed in step with the framework
- Built-in espresso idling resource support

And more!...

## Getting started in three simple steps

```kotlin
implementation("com.babylon.orbit2:orbit-viewmodel:<latest-version>")
```

### Define the contract

First, we need to define its state and declared side effects.

``` kotlin
data class CalculatorState(
    val total: Int = 0
)

sealed class CalculatorSideEffect {
    data class Toast(val text: String) : CalculatorSideEffect()
}
```

The only requirement here is that the objects are comparable. We also recommend
they be immutable. Therefore we suggest using a mix of data classes, sealed
classes and objects.

### Create the ViewModel

Using the core Orbit functionality, we can create a simple, functional
ViewModel.

1. Implement the
   [ContainerHost](orbit-2-core/src/main/java/com/babylon/orbit2/ContainerHost.kt)
   interface
1. Override the `container` field and use the `ViewModel.container` factory
   function to build an Orbit
   [Container](orbit-2-core/src/main/java/com/babylon/orbit2/Container.kt) in
   your
   [ContainerHost](orbit-2-core/src/main/java/com/babylon/orbit2/ContainerHost.kt)

``` kotlin
class CalculatorViewModel: ContainerHost<CalculatorState, CalculatorSideEffect>, ViewModel() {

    // Include `orbit-viewmodel` for the factory function
    override val container = container<CalculatorState, CalculatorSideEffect>(CalculatorState())

    fun add(number: Int) = intent {
        postSideEffect(CalculatorSideEffect.Toast("Adding $number to ${state.total}!"))

        reduce {
            state.copy(total = state.total + number)
        }
    }
}
```

We have used an Android `ViewModel` as the most common example, but there is no
requirement to do so. You can host an Orbit
[Container](orbit-2-core/src/main/java/com/babylon/orbit2/Container.kt) in a
simple class if you wish. This makes it possible to use in simple Kotlin
projects as well as lifecycle independent services.

### Connect to the ViewModel in your Activity or Fragment

Now we need to wire up the `ViewModel` to our UI. We expose coroutine
`Flow`s through which one can conveniently subscribe to updates.
Alternatively you can convert these to your preferred type using
externally provided extension methods e.g.
[asLiveData](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/package-summary#(kotlinx.coroutines.flow.Flow).asLiveData(kotlin.coroutines.CoroutineContext,%20kotlin.Long))
or
[asObservable](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-rx3/kotlinx.coroutines.rx3/kotlinx.coroutines.flow.-flow/as-observable.html).

``` kotlin
class CalculatorActivity: AppCompatActivity() {

    // Example of injection using koin, your DI system might differ
    private val viewModel by viewModel<CalculatorViewModel>()

    override fun onCreate(savedState: Bundle?) {
        ...
        addButton.setOnClickListener { viewModel.add(1234) }

        lifecycleScope.launchWhenCreated {
            viewModel.container.stateFlow.collect { render(it) }
        }
        lifecycleScope.launchWhenCreated {
            viewModel.container.sideEffectFlow.collect { handleSideEffect(it) }
        }
    }

    private fun render(state: CalculatorState) {
        ...
    }

    private fun handleSideEffect(sideEffect: CalculatorSideEffect) {
        when (sideEffect) {
            is CalculatorSideEffect.Toast -> toast(sideEffect.text)
        }
    }
}

```

## Modules

Orbit 2 is a modular framework. The Core module provides basic Orbit
functionality with additional features provided through optional modules.

Orbit supports using various async/stream frameworks at the same time so it is
perfect for legacy codebases. For example, it can support both RxJava 2 and
coroutines if you are in the process of migrating from one to the other.

At the very least you will need the `orbit-core` module to get started,
alternatively include one of the other modules which already include
`orbit-core`.

```kotlin
implementation("com.babylon.orbit2:orbit-core:<latest-version>")
implementation("com.babylon.orbit2:orbit-viewmodel:<latest-version>")

// strict syntax DSL extensions
implementation("com.babylon.orbit2:orbit-coroutines:<latest-version>")
implementation("com.babylon.orbit2:orbit-rxjava1:<latest-version>")
implementation("com.babylon.orbit2:orbit-rxjava2:<latest-version>")
implementation("com.babylon.orbit2:orbit-rxjava3:<latest-version>")
implementation("com.babylon.orbit2:orbit-livedata:<latest-version>")

testImplementation("com.babylon.orbit2:orbit-test:<latest-version>")
```

## Syntax

There are two orbit syntaxes to choose from.

We recommend using the simple syntax if you're just starting out as it's the
most up-to-date one. However, if you want to use Orbit in an existing project we
recommend you read about both and make your choice based on what's more suitable.

### Simple syntax

This syntax integrates with the coroutine framework to bring you something that
you will be very comfortable with if you already use coroutines for your
project. On the other hand, it's slightly easier to make mistakes if you don't
know how to use coroutines effectively. For example, blocking code in
`intent` can block your `Container`.

Pros:

- Extremely light and flexible
- Your MVI logic executes in a suspend function
- Interoperability with e.g. RxJava achieved through standard Kotlin libraries
  
Cons:
  
- Your code has to conform to coroutine best practices

``` kotlin
class MyViewModel: ContainerHost<MyState, MySideEffect>, ViewModel() {

    override val container = container<MyState, MySideEffect>(MyState())

    fun loadDataForId(id: Int) = intent {
        postSideEffect(MySideEffect.Toast("Loading data for $id!"))

        val result = repository.loadData(id)

        reduce {
            state.copy(data = result)
        }
    }
}

```

### Strict syntax

The _classic_ orbit syntax is based on streams. It's close to how MVI is often
portrayed - a reactive cycle. This syntax is great if you're in a legacy code
base with lots of RxJava. Especially if you're thinking of migrating to
coroutines, since you can mix and match both. However it's not as flexible as
the simple syntax due to being stream-based. It's strictness can be an advantage
in larger teams.

Pros:

- Relatively simple
- Hard to make mistakes
- Familiar if you use streams a lot
- Great for code-bases where RxJava and coroutines are mixed
  
Cons:
  
- Control-flow logic (e.g. reducing conditionally) is awkward to create
- Not as readable or flexible as the simple syntax
- Interoperability with e.g. RxJava achieved through extra orbit modules

``` kotlin
class MyViewModel: ContainerHost<MyState, MySideEffect>, ViewModel() {

    override val container = container<MyState, MySideEffect>(MyState())

    fun loadDataForId(id: Int) = orbit {
        sideEffect { post(MySideEffect.Toast("Loading data for $id!")) }
            .transformSuspend { repository.loadData(id) }
            .reduce {
                state.copy(data = result)
            }
    }
}

```

## A bit of history

We originally set out to create Orbit with the following principles in mind:

- Simple
- Flexible
- Testable
- Designed for, but not limited to Android

Orbit 1 was our first attempt at this, and while it worked well in general, it
fell short of our expectations when it came to its flexibility and testability.
It did not support coroutines with support hard to incorporate, as it was
rigidly dependent on RxJava 2. The users were not shielded from this either. As
we were migrating to coroutines ourselves, this was increasing the complexity
of our code.

We thought we had taken Orbit 1 as far as we could. Having learned a great deal
about MVI in Orbit 1, we set out to take another shot at this. We resolved to
keep the good things of Orbit 1 and redesign it from the ground up to live up
to our standards as Orbit 2. We think - hopefully, finally - we hit the sweet
spot.

We stand on the shoulders of giants:

- [RxFeedback](https://github.com/NoTests/RxFeedback.kt)
- [Mosby MVI](https://github.com/sockeqwe/mosby)
- [MvRx](https://github.com/airbnb/MvRx)

Thank you so much to everyone in the community for the support, whether direct
or not.
