## Overview

Orbit is a simple scaffolding you can build a Redux/MVI-like architecture
around.

It runs on top of coroutines but is built to be framework agnostic when it comes
to usage. This helps incorporating it into legacy code bases. For example, it
can support both RxJava 2 and coroutines (even on the same screen!) if you are
in the process of migrating from one to the other.

This latest project is Orbit 2 which we have recently [rewritten from scratch
based on Orbit 1.](#a-bit-of-history) Be advised that we have not tested it in
production yet. However, we have heavily unit tested it based on our previous
Orbit 1 requirements and experience. We would suggest using Orbit 2 over Orbit 1
for new and existing projects as we are actively working on it.

If you are risk-averse, we will continue to support Orbit 1 with
necessary fixes for some time as we use it in our projects.

[Orbit 1 is available here.](https://github.com/babylonhealth/orbit-mvi/tree/orbit/main)

The readme below covers only Orbit 2.

## Getting started

Orbit 2 is a modular framework. The Core module provides basic Orbit
functionality with additional features provided through optional modules.

Orbit supports using various async/stream frameworks at the same time so it is
perfect for legacy codebases. For example, it can support both RxJava 2 and
coroutines if you are in the process of migrating from one to the other.

At the very least you will need the `orbit-core` module to get started,
alternatively include one of the other modules which already include
`orbit-core`.

```kotlin
implementation("com.babylon.orbit2:orbit-core:<latest-version>")
implementation("com.babylon.orbit2:orbit-coroutines:<latest-version>")
implementation("com.babylon.orbit2:orbit-rxjava2:<latest-version>")
implementation("com.babylon.orbit2:orbit-rxjava3:<latest-version>")
implementation("com.babylon.orbit2:orbit-livedata:<latest-version>")
implementation("com.babylon.orbit2:orbit-viewmodel:<latest-version>")

testImplementation("com.babylon.orbit2:orbit-test:<latest-version>")
```

## Creating a simple Orbit 2 ViewModel

Using the core Orbit functionality, we can create a simple, functional
ViewModel.

### Include the dependencies

```kotlin
implementation("com.babylon.orbit2:orbit-viewmodel:<latest-version>")
```

### Define the contract

First, we need to define its state and declared side effects.

``` kotlin
data class CalculatorState(
    val total: Int = 0
)

sealed class CalculatorSideEffect {
    data class Toast(val text: String) : CalculatorSideEffect()
}
```

The only requirement here is that the objects are comparable. We also recommend
they be immutable. Therefore we suggest using a mix of data classes, sealed
classes and objects.

### Create the ViewModel

Next, we can define the ViewModel.

1. Implement the
   [ContainerHost](orbit-2-core/src/main/java/com/babylon/orbit2/ContainerHost.kt)
   interface
1. Override the `container` field and use the `ViewModel.container` factory
   function to build an Orbit
   [Container](orbit-2-core/src/main/java/com/babylon/orbit2/Container.kt) in
   your
   [ContainerHost](orbit-2-core/src/main/java/com/babylon/orbit2/ContainerHost.kt)

``` kotlin
class CalculatorViewModel: ContainerHost<CalculatorState, CalculatorSideEffect>, ViewModel() {

    // Include `orbit-viewmodel` for the factory function
    override val container = container<CalculatorState, CalculatorSideEffect>(CalculatorState())

    fun add(number: Int) = orbit {
        sideEffect {
            post(CalculatorSideEffect.Toast("Adding $number to ${state.total}!"))
        }
            .reduce {
                state.copy(total = state.total + number)
            }
    }

    fun subtract(number: Int) = orbit {
        sideEffect {
            post(CalculatorSideEffect.Toast("Subtracting $number from ${state.total}!"))
        }
            .reduce {
                state.copy(total = state.total - number)
            }
    }
}
```

We have used an Android `ViewModel` as the most common example, but there is no
requirement to do so. You can host an Orbit
[Container](orbit-2-core/src/main/java/com/babylon/orbit2/Container.kt) in a
simple class if you wish. This makes it possible to use in simple Kotlin
projects as well as lifecycle independent services.

## Connecting to a ViewModel

Now we need to wire up the `ViewModel` to our UI. Orbit provides various methods
of connecting via optional modules. For Android, the most convenient way to
connect is via `LiveData`, as it manages subscription disposal automatically.

``` kotlin
class CalculatorActivity: AppCompatActivity() {

    // Example of injection using koin, your DI system might differ
    private val viewModel by viewModel<CalculatorViewModel>()

    override fun onCreate(savedState: Bundle?) {
        ...
        addButton.setOnClickListener { viewModel.add(1234) }
        subtractButton.setOnClickListener { viewModel.subtract(1234) }

        // NOTE: Live data support is provided by the live data module:
        // com.babylon.orbit2:orbit-livedata
        viewModel.container.state.observe(this, Observer { render(it) })
        viewModel.container.sideEffect.observe(this, Observer { handleSideEffect(it) })
    }

    private fun render(state: CalculatorState) {
        ...
    }

    private fun handleSideEffect(sideEffect: CalculatorSideEffect) {
        when (sideEffect) {
            is CalculatorSideEffect.Toast -> toast(sideEffect.text)
        }
    }
}

```

## A bit of history

We originally set out to create Orbit with the following principles in mind:

- Simple
- Flexible
- Testable
- Designed for, but not limited to Android

Orbit 1 was our first attempt at this, and while it worked well in general, it
fell short of our expectations when it came to its flexibility and testability.
It did not support coroutines with support hard to incorporate, as it was
rigidly dependent on RxJava 2. The users were not shielded from this either. As
we were migrating to coroutines ourselves, this was increasing the complexity
of our code.

We thought we had taken Orbit 1 as far as we could. Having learned a great deal
about MVI in Orbit 1, we set out to take another shot at this. We resolved to
keep the good things of Orbit 1 and redesign it from the ground up to live up
to our standards as Orbit 2. We think - hopefully, finally - we hit the sweet
spot.

We stand on the shoulders of giants:

- [Managing State with RxJava by Jake Wharton](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/656ter/managing_state_with_rxjava_by_jake_wharton/)
- [RxFeedback](https://github.com/NoTests/RxFeedback.kt)
- [Mosby MVI](https://github.com/sockeqwe/mosby)
- [MvRx](https://github.com/airbnb/MvRx)

Thank you so much to everyone in the community for the support, whether direct
or not.
